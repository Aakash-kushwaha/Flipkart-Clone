#Flipkart clone
##This is our Third project at Masai School Unit-3 construct week.

We have tried our best to make a fully-functional clone of Zara Home website that provides a minimal user experience

where users can roam around and purchase their desired items. 
Here is the link of our website live on Netlify: https://startling-hotteok-ee84f0.netlify.app/

Flipkart is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company.

A user can register his account on the website.

User can log in using credentials given during registration.

User can search for various types of items such as Bedsheets, Napkins, Placemats, Flatsheets and much more.

User can filter and sort product prices from high to low or low to high.

User can make payments and succcessfully purchase their items. Zara Home Clone -

Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
